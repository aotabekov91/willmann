The Master does his job and then stops.

He understands that the universe is forever out of control,
and that trying to dominate events is against the Tao.

Because he believes in himself,
he doesn't try to convince others.

Because he is content with himself,
he doesn't need others' approval.

Because he accepts himself,
the whole world accepts him.
